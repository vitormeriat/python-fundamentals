    "However, if you learned another object-oriented language before Python, you may find it strange to use `len(collection)` instead of `collection.len()`. This apparent oddity is the tip of an iceberg that, when properly understood, is the key to everything we call *Pythonic*. The iceberg is called the Python Data Model, and it is the API that we use to make our own objects play well with the most idiomatic language features.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can think of the data model as a description of Python as a framework. It formalizes the interfaces of the building blocks of the language itself, such as sequences, functions, iterators, coroutines, classes, context managers, and so on.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Python interpreter invokes special methods to perform basic object operations, often triggered by special syntax. The special method names are always written with leading and trailing double underscores. For example, the syntax `obj[key]` is supported by the `__getitem__` special method. In order to evaluate `my_collection[key]`, the interpreter calls `my_collection.__getitem__(key)`.\n",

   "source": [
    "The first thing to know about special methods is that they are meant to be called by the Python interpreter, and not by you. You don’t write `my_object.__len__()`. You write `len(my_object)` and, if `my_object` is an instance of a user-defined class, then Python calls the `__len__` method you implemented.\n",
    "\n",
    "But the interpreter takes a shortcut when dealing for built-in types like `list`, `str`, `bytearray`, or extensions like the NumPy arrays. Python variable-sized collections written in C include a struct called `PyVarObject`, which has an `ob_size` field holding the number of items in the collection. So, if `my_object` is an instance of one of those built-ins, then `len(my_object)` retrieves the value of the `ob_size` field, and this is much faster than calling a method.\n",
    "\n",
    "More often than not, the special method call is implicit. For example, the statement `for i in x:` actually causes the invocation of `iter(x)`, which in turn may call `x.__iter__()` if that is available, or use `x.__getitem__()`, as in the `FrenchDeck` example.\n",
    "\n",
    "Normally, your code should not have many direct calls to special methods. Unless you are doing a lot of metaprogramming, you should be implementing special methods more often than invoking them explicitly. The only special method that is frequently called by user code directly is `__init__` to invoke the initializer of the superclass in your own `__init__` implementation.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you need to invoke a special method, it is usually better to call the related built-in function (e.g., `len`, `iter`, `str`, etc.). These built-ins call the corresponding special method, but often provide other services and—for built-in types—are faster than method calls.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Emulating Numeric Types\n",
    "\n",
    "Several special methods allow user objects to respond to operators such as `+`. Here our goal is to further illustrate the use of special methods through another simple example. We will implement a class to represent two-dimensional vectors—that is, Euclidean vectors like those used in math and physics.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will start designing the API for such a class by writing a simulated console session that we can use later as a doctest.\n",

    ">>> v1 = Vector(2, 4)\n",

    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Note how the `+` operator results in a new Vector, displayed in a friendly format at the console. The `abs` built-in function returns the absolute value of integers and floats, and the magnitude of `complex` numbers, so to be consistent, our API also uses `abs` to calculate the magnitude of a vector. We can also implement the `*` operator to perform scalar multiplication (i.e., multiplying a vector by a number to make a new vector with the same direction and a multiplied magnitude)."

    "We implemented five special methods in addition to the familiar `__init__`. \n",
    "\n",
    "- **String Representation**: The `__repr__` special method is called by the `repr` built-in to get the string representation of the object for inspection. Without a custom `__repr__`, Python’s console would display a `Vector` instance `<Vector object at 0x10e100070>`. The interactive console and debugger call `repr` on the results of the expressions evaluated, as does the `%r` placeholder in classic formatting with the `%` operator, and the `!r` conversion field in the new [format string syntax](https://fpy.li/1-4) used in *f-strings* the `str.format` method. Note that the *f-string* in our `__repr__` uses `!r` to get the standard representation of the attributes to be displayed. This is good practice, because it shows the crucial difference between `Vector(1, 2)` and `Vector('1', '2')`—the latter would not work in the context of this example, because the constructor’s arguments should be numbers, not `str`.\n",
    "- **Boolean Value of a Custom Type**: Although Python has a `bool` type, it accepts any object in a Boolean context, such as the expression controlling an `if` or `while` statement, or as operands to `and`, `or`, and `not`. To determine whether a value `x` is *truthy* or *falsy*, Python applies `bool(x)`, which returns either `True` or `False`. By default, instances of user-defined classes are considered truthy, unless either `__bool__` or `__len__` is implemented. Basically, `bool(x)` calls `x.__bool__()` and uses the result. If `__bool__` is not implemented, Python tries to invoke `x.__len__()`, and if that returns zero, `bool` returns `False`. Otherwise `bool` returns `True`. Our implementation of `__bool__` is conceptually simple: it returns `False` if the magnitude of the vector is zero, `True` otherwise. We convert the magnitude to a Boolean using `bool(abs(self))` because `__bool__` is expected to return a Boolean. Outside of `__bool__` methods, it is rarely necessary to call `bool()` explicitly, because any object can be used in a Boolean context.\n",

    "One of the defining features of the `namedtuple` you saw earlier is that it is [immutable](https://medium.com/@meghamohan/mutable-and-immutable-side-of-python-c2145cf72747). That is, the value of its fields may never change. For many types of data classes, this is a great idea! To make a data class immutable, set `frozen=True` when you create it. For example, the following is an immutable version of the `Position` class"
