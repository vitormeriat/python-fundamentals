    "Write a `getChessSquareColor()` function that has parameters `column` and `row`. The function either returns `'black'` or 'white' depending on the color at the specified column and `row`. Chess boards are 8 x 8 spaces in size, and the columns and rows in this program begin at 0 and end at `7` like in Figure 9-1. If the arguments for `column` or row are outside the `0` to 7 range, the function returns a blank string.\n",

    "There is a pattern to the colors of a chess board. If the column and row are both even or both odd, then the space is white. If one is odd and the other is even, the space is black. Exercise #3, “Odd & Even” shows how the `%` modulo operator determines if a number (such as the one in the `column` and `row` parameter) is even or odd. Use this to write a condition that determines if the oddness or evenness of the column and row match.\n",

    "The function should first check whether the column or row argument is outside the `0` to `7` range of valid values. If so, the function should immediately return a blank string."
