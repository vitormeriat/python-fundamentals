GitBook is an amazing frontend style to present and organize contents (such as book chapters and blogs) on Web. The typical to deploy GitBook at [Github Pages][1] is building HTML files locally and then push to Github repository, usually to the `gh-pages` branch. However, it's quite annoying to repeat such workload and make it hard for people do version control via git for when there are generated HTML files to be staged in and out.

This theme takes style definition out of generated GitBook site and provided the template for Jekyll to rendering markdown documents to HTML, thus the whole site can be deployed to [Github Pages][1] without generating and uploading HTML bundle every time when there are changes to the original repository.

### The Python Program

The Python interpreter program is run as `python` and includes both the interpreter itself and the **Python compiler**, which is implicitly invoked, as and if needed, on imported modules.

#### Environment Variables

Besides PATH, other environment variables affect the `python` program. Some environment variables have the same effects as options passed to `python` on the command line, as we show in the next section. Several environment variables provide settings not available via command-line options. The following list covers just the basics of a few frequently used ones; for all details, see the [online docs](https://docs.python.org/3/using/cmdline.html#environment-variables).

#### Command-Line Syntax and Options

The Python interpreter command-line syntax can be summarized as follows:

```bash
[path]python {options} [-c command | -m module | file | -] {args}
```

Brackets (**[ ]**) enclose whatâ€™s optional, braces (**{ }**) enclose items of which zero or more may be present, and bars (**\|**) mean a choice among alternatives. Python uses a slash (**/**) for file paths, as in Unix.

### Running Python Programs

Running a Python script at a command line can be as simple as:

```
$ python hello.py
Hello World
```

The filename of the script can be any absolute or relative file path, and need not have any specific extension (though it is conventional to use a *.py* extension).
