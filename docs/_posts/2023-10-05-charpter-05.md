</div>


## Goals

This chapter will cover topics related to native Python and some external modules in the context of high performance. We will have code that can run on a single CPU, multiple coroutines, multiple CPUs, and multiple computers. We will also use the profiling output to guide optimizations. The main references are from High-Performance Python, 2nd Edition[^highperformancepy2ed].

## Introduction

**High-performance programming** involves minimizing the time it takes to move and manipulate data in a computer. This can be achieved by **reducing overhead** (writing more efficient code) or **finding better algorithms**. The idea is to reduce overhead to understand the underlying hardware better.

**Python's abstractions** hide the direct interactions with hardware, making it seem like a futile exercise to optimize hardware efficiency. However, **understanding the hardware's limitations** and how Python's abstractions handle data movement can lead to **writing high-performance Python programs**.

### The Fundamental Computer System

**Computers are composed of three basic components:** computing units, memory units, and connections. Each component has specific properties: computing units have processing speed, memory units have capacity and read/write speed, and connections have data transfer speed.

**A standard workstation** can be described at different levels of detail. **At a basic level,** it consists of a CPU, RAM, hard drive, and a bus. **At a more detailed level,** the CPU itself has multiple cache levels (L1, L2, etc.) with smaller capacities but faster speeds. **Modern architectures** often introduce new configurations (e.g., Intel's SkyLake CPUs). **Both levels** typically neglect the network connection, which is a slower connection to multiple other devices.

**To better understand these intricacies,** the following paragraphs will provide a brief description of the fundamental building blocks of a computer.
