## Intro

To learn Python from scratch, we suggest you start with the appropriate links from [the online docs/tutorial](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/).

Python style guide, use [PEP 8](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/) (optionally augmented by extra guidelines such as [The Hitchhiker’s Guide](http://docs.python-guide.org/en/latest/writing/style/), [CKAN’s](http://docs.ckan.org/en/latest/contributing/python.html), and [Google’s](https://google.github.io/styleguide/pyguide.html)).

## Lexical Structure

The lexical structure of a programming language is the set of basic rules that govern how you write programs in that language. It is the lowest-level syntax of the language, specifying such things as what variable names look like and how to denote comments. Each Python source file, like any other text file, is a sequence of characters. You can also usefully consider it a sequence of lines, tokens, or statements. These different lexical views complement each other. 

> Python is very particular about program layout, especially lines and indentation.

**Lines and Indentation**

Python programs are made up of a sequence of logical lines, which are groups of one or more physical lines. Logical lines are separated by blank lines or by the end of a physical line. Python uses indentation to indicate the block structure of a program, rather than using braces or other delimiters. All statements in a block must have the same indentation. The first statement in a source file must have no indentation, and statements typed at the interactive interpreter must also have no indentation.

**Character Sets**


### Tokens

Python breaks each logical line into a sequence of elementary lexical components known as **tokens**. Each token corresponds to a substring of the logical line. The normal token types are **`identifiers, keywords, operators, delimiters`**, and **`literals`**.

#### Identifiers

An *identifier* is a name used to specify a variable, function, class, module, or other object. An identifier starts with a letter (any character that Unicode classifies as a letter) or an underscore (`_`), followed by zero or more letters, underscores, digits or other characters that Unicode classifies as digits or combining marks (as defined in [Unicode® Standard Annex #31](https://unicode.org/reports/tr31/#Combining_Marks)).


#### Keywords

Python has 35 keywords, which are identifiers that Python reserves for special syntactic uses. Like identifiers, keywords are case-sensitive. You cannot use keywords as regular identifiers (thus, they’re sometimes known as “reserved words”). You can list them by importing the `keyword` module and printing `keyword.kwlist`.

```python
>>>import keyword
>>>keyword.kwlist
['False', 'None', 'True', 'and', 'as', 'assert', 'async', 'await', 'break', 'class', 'continue', 
    'def', 'del', 'elif', 'else', 'except', 'finally', 'for', 'from', 'global', 'if', 'import', 'in', 
    'is', 'lambda', 'nonlocal', 'not', 'or', 'pass', 'raise', 'return', 'try', 'while', 'with', 'yield']
```

In addition, Python 3.9 introduced the concept of *soft keywords*. Soft keywords are keywords that are context-sensitive. They are language keywords for some specific syntax constructs, but outside of those constructs they may be used as variable or function names, so they are *not* reserved words. No soft keywords were defined in Python **3.9**, just in Python **3.10**. You can list them from the `keyword` module by printing `keyword.softkwlist`.

```python
>>>keyword.softkwlist
['_', 'case', 'match']
```

#### Operators

Python uses non-alphanumeric characters and character combinations as operators. Python recognizes the following operators, which are covered in detail in “Expressions and Operators”:

```
+  -  *  /  %   **  //  <<  >>  &   @
|  ^  ~  <  <=  >   >=  <>  !=  ==  @=  :=
```

You can use `@` as an operator (in matrix multiplication, covered in Chapter 15), although the character is technically a delimiter.

#### Delimiters

Python uses the following characters and combinations as delimiters in expressions, list, dictionary, and set literals and comprehensions, and various statements, among other purposes:

```
(    )    [    ]    {    }
,    :    .    `    =    ;   @
+=   -=   *=   /=   //=  %=
&=   |=   ^=   >>=  <<=  **=
```

The period (`.`) can also appear in floating-point literals (e.g., `2.3`) and imaginary literals (e.g., `2.3j`). The last two rows are the augmented assignment operators, which are delimiters, but also perform operations. We discuss the syntax for the various delimiters when we introduce the objects or statements using them.

The following characters have special meanings as part of other tokens:

```
'  "  #  \
```

`'` and `"` surround string literals. `#` outside of a string starts a comment, which ends at the end of the current line. `\` at the end of a physical line joins the following physical line into one logical line; `\` is also an escape character in strings. The characters `$` and `?`, and all control characters[1](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/python-in-a/9781098113544/ch02.html#idm45405188657296) except whitespace, can never be part of the text of a Python program, except in comments or string literals.

#### Literals

A *literal* is the direct denotation in a program of a data value (a number, string, or container). The following are number and string literals in Python:

```
42                       # Integer literal
3.14                     # Floating-point literal
1.0j                     # Imaginary literal
'hello'                  # String literal
"world"                  # Another string literal
"""Good
night"""                 # Triple-quoted string literal, spanning 2 lines
```

Combining number and string literals with the appropriate delimiters, you can build literals that directly denote data values of container types:

```
[42, 3.14, 'hello']     # List
[]                      # Empty list
100, 200, 300           # Tuple
()                      # Empty tuple
{'x':42, 'y':3.14}      # Dictionary
{}                      # Empty dictionary
{1, 2, 4, 8, 'string'}  # Set

# There is no literal to denote an empty set; use set() instead
```

We cover the syntax for literals in detail in “Data Types”, when we discuss the various data types Python supports.


### Statements

You can look at a Python source file as a sequence of simple and compound statements.

#### Simple statements

A *simple statement* is one that contains no other statements. A simple statement lies entirely within a logical line. As in many other languages, you may place more than one simple statement on a single logical line, with a semicolon (`;`) as the separator. However, one statement per line is the usual and recommended Python style, and makes programs more readable.

Any *expression* can stand on its own as a simple statement (we discuss expressions in “Expressions and Operators”). When working interactively, the interpreter shows the result of an expression statement you enter at the prompt (`>>>`) and binds the result to a global variable named `_` (underscore). Apart from interactive sessions, expression statements are useful only to call functions (and other *callables*) that have side effects (e.g., perform output, change global variables, or raise exceptions).

An *assignment* is a simple statement that assigns values to variables, as we discuss in “Assignment Statements”. An assignment in Python using the `=` operator is a statement and can never be part of an expression. To perform an assignment as part of an expression, you must use the `:=` (jokingly known as the “walrus”) operator.

#### Compound statements

A *compound statement* contains one or more other statements and controls their execution. A compound statement has one or more *clauses*, aligned at the same indentation. Each clause has a *header* starting with a keyword and ending with a colon (`:`), followed by a *body*, which is a sequence of one or more statements. Normally, these statements, also known as a *block*, are on separate logical lines after the header line, indented four spaces rightward. The block lexically ends when the indentation returns to that of the clause header (or further left from there, to the indentation of some enclosing compound statement). Alternatively, the body can be a single simple statement, following the `:` on the same logical line as the header. The body may also consist of several simple statements on the same line with semicolons between them, but, as we’ve already mentioned, this is not good Python style.

A wide tables needs to be wrapped into a `div` with class `table-wrapper`
to make sure it displayed as expected on mobile devices. For example,

```markdown
<div class="table-wrapper" markdown="block">

|title1|title2|title3|title4|title5|title6|title7|title8|
|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|
|1|2|3|4|5|6|7|8|
|1|2|3|4|5|6|7|8|
|1|2|3|4|5|6|7|8|
|1|2|3|4|5|6|7|8|

</div>
```

Will be rendered as

<div class="table-wrapper" markdown="block">

|title1|title2|title3|title4|title5|title6|title7|title8|
|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|
|1|2|3|4|5|6|7|8|
|1|2|3|4|5|6|7|8|
|1|2|3|4|5|6|7|8|
|1|2|3|4|5|6|7|8|

</div>
