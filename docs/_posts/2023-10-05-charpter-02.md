</div>


## Intro

To learn Python from scratch, we suggest you start with the appropriate links from [the online docs/tutorial](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/).

Python style guide, use [PEP 8](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/) (optionally augmented by extra guidelines such as [The Hitchhiker’s Guide](http://docs.python-guide.org/en/latest/writing/style/), [CKAN’s](http://docs.ckan.org/en/latest/contributing/python.html), and [Google’s](https://google.github.io/styleguide/pyguide.html)).

## Lexical Structure

The lexical structure of a programming language is the set of basic rules that govern how you write programs in that language. It is the lowest-level syntax of the language, specifying such things as what variable names look like and how to denote comments. Each Python source file, like any other text file, is a sequence of characters. You can also usefully consider it a sequence of lines, tokens, or statements. These different lexical views complement each other. 

> Python is very particular about program layout, especially lines and indentation.

This jekyll-theme supports tips, warnings, and dangers blocks and the style is referred

> this or a similar version after installation.
{: .block-tip }
```

### Warnings

```markdown

> before continuing, as we'll be making use of features like these.
{: .block-warning }
```

A wide tables needs to be wrapped into a `div` with class `table-wrapper`
to make sure it displayed as expected on mobile devices. For example,

```markdown
<div class="table-wrapper" markdown="block">

|title1|title2|title3|title4|title5|title6|title7|title8|
|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|
|1|2|3|4|5|6|7|8|
|1|2|3|4|5|6|7|8|
|1|2|3|4|5|6|7|8|
|1|2|3|4|5|6|7|8|

</div>
```

Will be rendered as

<div class="table-wrapper" markdown="block">

|title1|title2|title3|title4|title5|title6|title7|title8|
|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|
|1|2|3|4|5|6|7|8|
|1|2|3|4|5|6|7|8|
|1|2|3|4|5|6|7|8|
|1|2|3|4|5|6|7|8|

</div>
