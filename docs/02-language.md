# 02. The Python Language

To learn Python from scratch, we suggest you start with the appropriate links from [the online docs/tutorial](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/).

Python style guide, use [PEP 8](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/) (optionally augmented by extra guidelines such as [The Hitchhiker’s Guide](http://docs.python-guide.org/en/latest/writing/style/), [CKAN’s](http://docs.ckan.org/en/latest/contributing/python.html), and [Google’s](https://google.github.io/styleguide/pyguide.html)).
