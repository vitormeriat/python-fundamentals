## Intro

To learn Python from scratch, we suggest you start with the appropriate links from [the online docs/tutorial](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/).

Python style guide, use [PEP 8](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/) (optionally augmented by extra guidelines such as [The Hitchhiker’s Guide](http://docs.python-guide.org/en/latest/writing/style/), [CKAN’s](http://docs.ckan.org/en/latest/contributing/python.html), and [Google’s](https://google.github.io/styleguide/pyguide.html)).

## Lexical Structure

The lexical structure of a programming language is the set of basic rules that govern how you write programs in that language. It is the lowest-level syntax of the language, specifying such things as what variable names look like and how to denote comments. Each Python source file, like any other text file, is a sequence of characters. You can also usefully consider it a sequence of lines, tokens, or statements. These different lexical views complement each other. 

> Python is very particular about program layout, especially lines and indentation.
